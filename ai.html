                Artificial intelligence, better known as AI, is defined as being the simulation of human intelligence in machines that have been programmed to interact as a human (Burns, n.d.). This is a system developed to perform tasks that require human intelligence. <br><br> There are two types of AI: <br>
            <br>•Narrow AI: This type of AI is known as weak; the AI is able to perform specific predefined functions but lacks the intelligence of humans.
            <br> •General AI:  This type of AI is known to be strong; this AI system has the ability to understand, learn, as well as apply the knowledge it has across a wide range of tasks.  
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p>
                AI applications span various industries, like healthcare, finance, education, manufacturing and many more. As technology continues to advance, so do the capabilities of AI, leading to new possibilities and challenges.
