                <b> Information <br><span>Quality</span></b>
            </h1>
            <p>
                Information quality is the quality of the information that the systems produce.The extent to which information can help add value to a business process and the value of information depends on its quality.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><b><u>Characteristics/Factors you will find within data quality.</u></b></p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Accuracy:</b></p>
            <p>Information is accurate if its value is acceptably close to the value that a perfect calculation using perfect inputs would produce.
               <br>Example: Financial reports with accurate figures, error-free customer records.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Completeness:</b></p>
            <p>Information is complete when it is based on the relevant factors, omitting none. <br>
                Example: A comprehensive customer profile with contact details, purchase history, and preferences.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Reliability:</b></p>
        	 <p>In the realm of data quality characteristics, reliability means that a piece of information doesnâ€™t contradict another piece of information in a different source or system. <br>
                Example: Reliable supplier performance data, consistent production metrics.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Relevance:</b></p>
            <p>The level to which a piece of information is relevant and helpful for a specific purpose. <br>
                Example: Marketing data relevant to a specific target audience, industry trends for strategic planning
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Timeliness:</b></p>
            <p> One of the simplest but most important concepts in accounting. For information to be valuable, it usually has to be current. The financial state of the company should be disclosed to investors and other users in the present, not in the past. Past data, however, can still be helpful for identifying patterns and may be particularly helpful for assessing managerial stewardship.</p>
          	<br>
            <p><b>Consistency:</b></p>
            <p>Makes certain that information is consistent and logical across many databases or sources. <br>
                Example: having the same product descriptions on the website, in sales brochures, and in marketing materials.</p>
            <br>
             <p><b>	Accessibility:</b></p>
             <p>The simplicity with which authorized individuals can obtain information. <br>
                Example: Accessible databases and user-friendly dashboards facilitate quick access of information.
            </p>  
            <br>
            <p><b>Precision:</b></p>
            <p>The degree of specificity and clarity in the information. <br>
                Example: Accurate stock levels and thorough evaluations of client input.
            </p><br>
            <p><b><u>Evaluation methods:</u></b></p>
           <br>
           <p><b>Data profiling:</b></p>
            <p>Examining a dataset's relationships, content, and organization to find irregularities or inconsistencies.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Data quality tools:</b></p>
            <p>Use specialist tools like IBM InfoSphere, Talend, or Informatica to evaluate and enhance data quality.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>	Data audits: </b></p>
            <p>Confirming data completeness, correctness, and compliance with quality standards by conducting routine audits.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>User feedback:</b></p>
            <p>Obtaining end-user comments on the applicability and relevancy of the supplied informationO</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Comparative analysis:</b></p>
            <p>comparing information from many sources to find differences and guarantee accuracy.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Data governance:</b></p>
            <p>Defining and implementing roles, processes, and regulations to guarantee data quality.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Data validation:</b></p>
            <p>Using validation criteria throughout data entry or integration operations to guarantee data consistency and accuracy.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b><u>Benefits:</u></b></p>
            <p><b>Informed Decision Making</b></p>

            <br>
            <p><b>Innovation and research: </b></p>
            <p>Research and innovation are built on top of high-quality information. Accurate data is essential for scientists, researchers, and innovators to create new technologies, gain new insights, and expand knowledge across a range of disciplines.</p>
            <br>
